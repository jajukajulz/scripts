Sometimes the need arises to convert from LaTeX to MS Word. Going via HTML often produces good results.

tex4ht is a system for conversion from TeX to many different output formats, such as HTML, ODT or Epub.
The system consists from several different programs, which are executed by a compilation script.
The basic compilation script is htlatex which has been superseded by make4ht.

Locate texbin directory e.g. /Library/TeX/texbin/
Confirm make4ht is in the texbin location otherwise install via Tex Live Utility or Commandline (tlmgr)
$sudo tlmgr install make4ht luaxml tex4ht environ

Add texbin location to PATH variable
`$export PATH=/Library/TeX/texbin:$PATH`

Run conversion to HTML
$make4ht mydocument.tex # generate HTML

To create MS WORD DOCX, first convert to ODT then from ODT save as DOCX (ODT is LibreOffice in Ubuntu)
The reason for first converting to ODT format is that ODT can keep some features like footnotes. Also, although MS Word can handle ODT format, it can be buggy so often it is better to convert the ODT file to DOCX using LibreOffice.
$make4ht -f odt filename.tex

Using htlatex for most basic form
`$htlatex mydocument.tex` # generate HTML

=================

Alternatively, use PANDOC (the free and open-source document converter)

Here's how.  Assume I've written something "myTexFile.tex" with an accompanying bibliography "myTexBiblio.bib" file.  On the command line:

pandoc mydocument.tex -f latex -t html -s -o myHtmlFile.html --bibliography mydocumentBiblio.bib

The args:

    -f source format (LaTeX)
    -t target format (HTML)
    -s standalone HTML file
    -o output filename
    --bibliography  .bib file for the citations used in mydocument.tex
