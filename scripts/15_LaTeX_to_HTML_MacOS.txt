1. Find your texbin directory. This is usually /usr/texbin, which is symlinked to wherever the actual directory is.
2. Add it to your PATH (i.e. `# export PATH=/usr/texbin:$PATH`)
3. Run the 'htlatex' command. This will convert your LaTeX file into an HTML document. Note that this really just a script around normal LaTeX, so you'll have to do the usual things (htlatex -> bibtex -> htlatex for citations, htlatex -> htlatex for references). I think: I had my LaTeX all PDF-LaTeXed and ready to go, so all the .bib/.toc/etc. files had already been created.
4. At this point, you have an HTML file. Check it and make sure it's good enough.

5. Open the HTML file in TextEdit. Oddly enough, Pages can't open HTML files, but TextEdit can. Go figure.
6. TextEdit can now save your file as an RTF or Doc file.
7. Success!


tex4ht is a system for conversion from TeX to many different output formats, such as HTML, ODT or Epub.
The system consists from several different programs, which are executed by a compilation script.
The basic compilation script is htlatex which has been superseded by make4ht.

Locate texbin directory e.g. /Library/TeX/texbin/
Confirm make4ht is in the texbin location otherwise install via Tex Live Utility or Commandline (tlmgr)
$sudo tlmgr install make4ht luaxml tex4ht environ


Add texbin location to PATH variable
`$export PATH=/Library/TeX/texbin:$PATH`

Run conversion to HTML
$make4ht mydocument.tex # generate HTML

To create MS WORD DOCX, first convert to ODT then from ODT save as DOCX (ODT is LibreOffice in Ubuntu)
For Word inclusion, it is best to use the ODT format, which can keep some features like footnotes. Word can handle this format,
but it's support is buggy, so it is best to convert the ODT files to DOCX using LibreOffice.
$make4ht -f odt filename.tex

Previously when htlatex was used
`$htlatex mydocument.tex` # generate HTML


=================
Alternatively, use PANDOC (the free and open-source document converter)

Here's how.  Assume I've written something "myTexFile.tex" with an accompanying bibliography "myTexBiblio.bib" file.  On the command line:

pandoc mydocument.tex -f latex -t html -s -o myHtmlFile.html --bibliography mydocumentBiblio.bib

The args:

    -f source format (LaTeX)

    -ttarget format (HTML)

    -s 'standalone' HTML file

    -o output filename

    --bibliography  .bib file for the citations used in mydocument.tex
